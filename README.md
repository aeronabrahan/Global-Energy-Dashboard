# Global Energy Consumption Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** for analyzing global energy consumption trends. The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore energy usage data across different countries, continents, and time periods to identify key insights, trends, and potential areas for improvement.

---

## Objectives
1. **Analyze Global Energy Consumption Trends:** Understand how energy consumption has evolved over the years.
2. **Identify Key Energy Consumers:** Highlight countries with the highest and lowest energy usage.
3. **Assess Energy Efficiency:** Determine the most energy-efficient countries based on consumption per capita.
4. **Enable Interactive Data Exploration:** Provide a visually intuitive dashboard for dynamic data filtering and analysis.
5. **Support Data-Driven Decision Making:** Offer actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders.

## Key Findings
1. **The U.S. and China dominate global energy consumption,** significantly surpassing other countries.
2. **Energy consumption has been steadily increasing,** with key growth periods observed in industrialized nations.
3. **Some countries maintain high efficiency,** balancing economic output with lower energy consumption.
4. **Regions like Asia and North America account for the majority of energy use.**
5. **Sustainable energy practices are crucial,** as global consumption trends indicate rising demand.
