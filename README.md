## Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes global energy consumption trends. The dashboard includes various data visualizations such as a world map, trend analysis, and comparative statistics to provide insights into energy consumption patterns.

## Features
1. **Interactive Map** – Displays energy consumption by country with bubble sizes representing consumption levels.
2. **Yearly Energy Trend** – A line chart illustrating the historical trend of global energy consumption.
3. **Top 10 Energy-Consuming Countries** – A ranked bar chart displaying the highest consumers of energy.
4. **Energy Consumption by Continent** – A pie chart breaking down energy consumption by continent.
5. **Key Metrics** – Includes total energy consumption, top consumer country, and most energy-efficient country.
6. **Filters** – Users can filter data by year and country to customize the analysis.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project consists of global energy consumption records spanning multiple decades. The data has been processed and cleaned for effective visualization.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aeronabrahan/Global-Energy-Dashboard.git
   ```
2. Open the Power BI file (`World Energy Consumption.pbix`).
3. Ensure Power BI Desktop is installed.
4. Explore and interact with the dashboard.

## Deployment
The dashboard is deployed using **GitHub Pages**:
- **URL**: [https://aeronabrahan.github.io/Global-Energy-Dashboard/](https://aeronabrahan.github.io/Global-Energy-Dashboard/)
- **Configuration**:
  - `_config.yml` contains the remote theme settings.
  - Assets such as images and the favicon are stored in `/assets/images/`.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals clear disparities in energy consumption across regions, highlighting the dominance of certain countries in total consumption. The insights generated can help in policy-making, energy efficiency strategies, and sustainability planning.

## Recommendations
1. Promote energy-efficient practices in high-consumption countries.
2. Explore alternative energy sources to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
3. Implement stricter energy regulations to control excessive consumption.
4. Conduct further analysis on renewable energy adoption trends.
